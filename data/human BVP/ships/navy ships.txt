	description "The Auxiliary is the Republic Navy's logistical backbone. The size and durability of a capital ship but more cargo and passenger space than any other Navy ship, the Auxiliary is used whenever the Navy needs large amounts of troops or cargo transported with a guarantee that they'll reach the destination."
	description "The Auxiliary was built with modularity in mind, allowing the ship to be fitted for more cargo or bunk space depending on the mission. This modularity makes the ship rather expensive to build, however, and therefore a rare sight to see."

	description "The Carrier is more than just a warship: it is practically a mobile space station, with docking bays for an entire squadron of drones and fighters and enough crew to fill a small village. Although designed primarily for engaging enemies from a distance, a Carrier can also do significant damage in close combat."

	description "Combat drones are pilotless attack ships used primarily by the Republic Navy. Although very weak and easy to destroy, they can be very effective in large numbers. Because drones do not need a cockpit, they can be filled entirely with equipment and solid metal, which makes their hulls stronger than other small ships."
	description "	Drones do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a drone unless you have a ship in your fleet with a drone bay."

	description "The Republic Cruiser is a relatively recent design, a much larger version of the Frigate designed to be able to take on an entire pirate fleet if necessary. In addition to a wide variety of weaponry, Cruisers have space to carry four attack drones: fast, pilotless fighters that can be controlled remotely."

	description "Dropships were designed with the Navy's Auxiliary in mind. Landed Auxiliaries often act as forward operating bases, so troops needing transport to another area often rely on their Dropships. This cramped and uncomfortable vessel is able to move a squad of Republic soldiers at great speed for its size."

	description "For centuries, the Frigate was the largest warship produced by the Republic Navy Yard, but now they seem quite small compared to a Cruiser or a Carrier. Armed with a variety of weapons, the Frigate is equally capable at fending off small fighters or bombarding larger ships. In its time it possessed relatively good maneuverability for a ship of its size, but now it sees continued use mostly due to the sheer number of them already built for service."

	description "The Rainmaker is a missile boat built in the Republic Navy Yard. It comes equipped with four missile launchers and enough ammunition to destroy even ships many times its size. Because of their lack of maneuverability and relatively light shielding, Rainmakers serve best as long-range attack ships, and once their missile supply is spent, they are relatively useless in combat."
