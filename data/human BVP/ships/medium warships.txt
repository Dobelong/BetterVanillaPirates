	description "The Lionheart Aerie is a light carrier, designed to be just big enough for two fighter bays plus a decent armament of its own. Variations on this same ship design have been in use in the Deep for almost half a millennium, but this model comes with the very latest in generator and weapon technology."

	description "The Betelgeuse Shipyards Firebird is a warship with a long and storied past; Firebirds fought on both sides of the Alpha Wars over half a millennium ago, and although the equipment and systems have been upgraded continuously since then, the basic design remains almost the same. The Firebird is also a very rugged ship and easy to repair; supposedly a few of the Firebirds that fought in those wars are still in service today."

	description "After their Quicksilver light warship with its armament of Particle Cannons became a large success with convoy escorts and planetary defense forces, Megaparsec decided to develop a larger ship with similar maneuverability but heavier firepower. The Manta is the result: a ship with enough long-range firepower that fleeing from a battle with it is almost impossible."

	description "After the Blackbird gained surprising popularity as an agile light warship despite its original design as a transport, Tarazed decided to produce a new design specifically intended as a warship. The Osprey was the result. Although it is considered overpriced by most savvy pilots, it is nevertheless a perennial favorite among those who have the extra cash to spend on it."

	description "The Splinter is the largest warship produced by the Megaparsec shipyard. It is designed to be faster and more maneuverable than other ships of a similar size, in order to serve as a heavy escort ship or as part of a planetary defense and patrol fleet. Because of its intended use in merchant convoys, it also has a fair amount of cargo space."
