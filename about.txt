This plugin makes human pirates, bounty hunters and repeating combat missions (spaceport + job board) far more varied and challenging, while adding combat missions that scale in difficulty all the way to the late game. It also unlocks Mk II upgraded human ships for purchase at New Tortuga in the mid-game.
Adds a new minor mission thread with instalments unlocked at CR9, 10, 11.
